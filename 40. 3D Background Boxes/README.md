## [3D Background Boxes](https://50projectsbymilan.000webhostapp.com/50projects/40_3D_background_boxes/)
Implemented the project such that:
- There will be a gif which will have 16 parts and each part will have a 3D effect.
- On clicking "Magic" button, if the gif is big then the gif should merge and original gif should be shown. If the "Magic" button is clicked when the gif is small then it should break into 16 pieces in 4x4 manner and each box should have a 3D effect.
