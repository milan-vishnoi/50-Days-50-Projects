## [Theme Clock](https://50projectsbymilan.000webhostapp.com/50projects/19_theme_clock/)
Implemented the Theme clock such that:
- Whenever the theme is Light, the Dark Mode button will be displayed. If that button is clicked then the theme will change to dark mode, vice versa when the theme is dark.
- The 3 needles of the clock representing hour hand, minutes hand and seconds hand should be displayed and should get updated every second.
- The should also be displayed in the following format: `HH:MM:SS AM/PM`.
- Date should be displayed below time in following format: `MONTH, Day`.
