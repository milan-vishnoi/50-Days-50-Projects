## [Random Image Feed](https://50projectsbymilan.000webhostapp.com/50projects/48_random_image_feed/)
Implemented the project such that:
- The user will be able to enter the number of rows and columns.
- When "Get Images" button is clicked, the images with the mentioned number of rows and columns will appear.
- When the images are loaded and again the "Get Images" button is clicked, the previous images should go away.
