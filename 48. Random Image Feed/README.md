## Random Image Feed
Implemented the project such that:
- The user will be able to enter the number of rows and columns.
- When "Get Images" button is clicked, the images with the mentioned number of rows and columns will appear.
- When the images are loaded and again the "Get Images" button is clicked, the previous images should go away.
