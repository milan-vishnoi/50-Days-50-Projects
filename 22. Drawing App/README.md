## [Drawing App](https://50projectsbymilan.000webhostapp.com/50projects/22_drawing_app/)
Implement the drawing app such that:
- When the mouse left button is clicked then a circle will be drawn.
- When the mouse left button is pressed and mouse moved, the line will be drawn following the trajectory on the canvas.
- The width of the line and the radius of the circle can be updated in the toolbox. The value can be incresed and decreased from 5 to 50 pixels.
- The color of the line can be chosen from the toolbox. 
- When the clear button is pressed, the entire canvas should be cleared.
