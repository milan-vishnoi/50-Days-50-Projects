## Random Choice Picker
Implemented a Random Choice picker such that:
- The user can enter the comma separated choices in the textbox. The leading and trailing spaces will be trimmed.
- Each choice will be shown as a tag below the text box.
- When enter is pressed, the random selection will start and the tags will keep on getting highlighted and unhighlighted.
- After few seconds, the picked tag will remain highlighted depicting that it is the selected choice.
