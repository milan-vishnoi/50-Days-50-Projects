## [Notes App](https://50projectsbymilan.000webhostapp.com/50projects/33_notes_app/)
Implemented the notes app such that:
- When the user clicks on "Add Note" button, the new note will be added.
- Note can be edited and deleted. 
- Notes will be saved in local storage(using browser's in-built localStorage api) so that the remain saved even after the session is ended and will be visible when the project/website is visited again.
- The notes should support markdown.
