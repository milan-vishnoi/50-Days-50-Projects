## Drink Water
Implemented the following:
- There will be a big cup of 2L and 8 small cups 250ml.
- Whenever small cup is clicked, it gets filled and the big cup also gets filled with 250ml.
- The small cups are numbered from 0 to 7.
- If a small cup is clicked then all the cup having the number less than it will also get filled(if they were empty)
- If filled cup of smaller number cup is clicked then only cups equal to and less than its number will be shown as filled rest all be shown as empty even if the higher number cups were filled earlier.
- Whenever a filled cup is clicked, it will be emptied.
