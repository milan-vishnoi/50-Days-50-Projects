## [Verify Account UI](https://50projectsbymilan.000webhostapp.com/50projects/41_verify_account_ui)
Implemented the UI project such that:
- Whenever a digit is entered into a box then the focus will automatically shift to the next box.
- When backspace is pressed, the active box's digit will be removed and the focus will shift to the previous box.
- When the input is entered to a box, it border color will change.
