## [Insect Catch Game](https://50projectsbymilan.000webhostapp.com/50projects/50_insect_catch_game/)
Implemented this project such that:
- The user can select his favourite insect. That insect will then appear on the screen.
- The time will get updated every second and when the user clicks on the insect then it be caught and the user will gain a point. The score will also be updated on the screen.
- Two new insects will appear on the screen for every caught insect.
- When the user score 20 points, a funny message will appear encouraging him to stop playing because the game is impossible to win.
