## [Double Heart Click](https://50projectsbymilan.000webhostapp.com/50projects/29_double_heart_click/)
Implemented the project such that:
- Whenever the user double clicks on the image, the heart will appear and disappear like it happens on Instagram.
- Everytime double click happens on the image, the count of number of times you liked it will also be updated.
- Double click will counted only if second click is max 800 ms after the first click.
