## [Sticky Navbar](https://50projectsbymilan.000webhostapp.com/50projects/25_sticky_navbar/)
Implemented the sticky navbar such that:
- When the page is scrolled down then after a certain point, the navigation bar will reduce in height and the background color will be changed from black to white.
- When the page is scrolled up again then the navigation bar will regain its original size and the balck background color.
