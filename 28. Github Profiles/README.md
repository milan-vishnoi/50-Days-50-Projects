## [Github Profiles](https://50projectsbymilan.000webhostapp.com/50projects/28_github_profiles/)
Implemented the project such that:
- Whenever user enters a github username , the github api will be called to fetch the user details. These details will then be displayed on the profile card.
- Along with the user details, the repositories detail will also be fecthed. The link of last 10 updated repositories for that user will be also be displayed in the card.
- Appropriate message will be displayed when a wrong username is entered or there is any issue in fetching the repository details.
