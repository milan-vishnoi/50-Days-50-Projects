## [Todo List](https://50projectsbymilan.000webhostapp.com/50projects/49_todo_list/)
Implemented todo list such that:
- The task can be added todo list by giving input.
- When user use left click on a task then the task will be considered completed and it will be striked out.
- When user use right click on a task then it will be deleted.
- The tasks will be saved in the local storage of the browser so that even if the user closes and then revisits the page again, the previous task which were not removed will be present on the page.
