## [Darg N Drop](https://50projectsbymilan.000webhostapp.com/50projects/21_drag_n_drop/)
Implemented Drag and Drop of the image such that:
- When the image is dragged, the box's background should change to white.
- When the image hovers over a box then the background of the box should change to the brown color.
- When the image is dropped into the box, it should appear fit in that box.
