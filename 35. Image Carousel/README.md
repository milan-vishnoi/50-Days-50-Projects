## Image Carousel
Implemented the project such that:
- The image will slide to left and the next image will appear within the carousel if a button is not presses.
- If "Prev" button is pressed then the previous image will be displayed, if "Next" button is pressed then the next image will appear.
- If no button is pressed for 2 seconds then the next image will automatically appear.
