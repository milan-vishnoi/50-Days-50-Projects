## Good, Cheap, Fast Checkboxes
Implemented the project such that:
- Whenever the choice is checked, the ball should move to the right and the backgorund color of toggle will change.
- Whenever the choice is unchecked, the ball should move to the left and the backgorund color of toggle will changed back to gray.
- When the two choices are already checked and the user checks the third one also then one of the previous checked choices will unchecked i.e the project can be either Good & Fast or Good & Cheap or Cheap & Fast. It can't be Good, Cheap and Fast.
