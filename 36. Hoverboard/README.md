## [Hoverboard](https://50projectsbymilan.000webhostapp.com/50projects/36_hoverboard/)
Implemented the project such that:
- Whenever the mouse is moved over the square, a random color and box shadow will be set for that square.
- After 2 seconds, the color and box shadow will automatically disappear(achieved this by adding transition delay of 2s for each sqaure).
