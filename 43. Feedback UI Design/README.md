## [Feedback UI Design](https://50projectsbymilan.000webhostapp.com/50projects/43_feedback_ui_design/)
Implemented project such that:
- There will be 3 different feedbacks on the screen. Whenever user will select a feedback, it will have a box shadow around it. By default "Satisfied" is selected.
- When the user clicks on "Submit Review" button, the feedback will be submitted and a Thank You message along with the submitted feedback will be displayed.
