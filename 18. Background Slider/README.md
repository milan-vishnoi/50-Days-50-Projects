## Background Slider
Implemented an image background slider such that:
- The image as well as the blurred background is displayed.
- When left or right arrow is clicked, the previous/next image should slide in.
- There should be a loop in slider i.e. if the last image is displayed and right arrow is clicked then first image should get displayed, vice versa for first image when left arrow is clicked.
