## [Quiz App](https://50projectsbymilan.000webhostapp.com/50projects/46_quiz_app/)
Implemented the Quiz App such that:
- The user can select the options and can submit the answer. When the user submits, the next question with its options will appear.
- If the user submits the last question then the score will be displayed after submitting.
- On the score page, the user will have option to click on "Reload" button and give the quiz again.
