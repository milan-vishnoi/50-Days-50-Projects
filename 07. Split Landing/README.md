## [Split Landing](https://50projectsbymilan.000webhostapp.com/50projects/07_split_landing/)
Implemented the split landing such that:
- When mouse is hovered on left side, the left side will take 75% of the screen width.
- When mouse is hovered on right side, the right side will take 75% of the screen width.
- When you hover the mouse on the button, the color of the button will change.
